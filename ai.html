    <h2>What is AI?</h2>
    <img src="img9.jpg" alt="AI Overview" class="center">
    <p></p>

    <p>The term artificial intelligence stirs emotions. For one thing there is our fascination
      with intelligence, which seemingly imparts to us humans a special place among
      life forms. Questions arise such as “What is intelligence?”, “How can one measure
      intelligence?” or “How does the brain work?”. All these questions are meaningful
      when trying to understand artificial intelligence. However, the central question for
      the engineer, especially for the computer scientist, is the question of the intelligent
      machine that behaves like a person, showing intelligent behavior.</p>

    <p>The attribute artificial might awaken much different associations. It brings up
      fears of intelligent cyborgs. It recalls images from science fiction novels. It raises
      the question of whether our highest good, the soul, is something we should try to
      understand, model, or even reconstruct.</p>
    
    <p>With such different offhand interpretations, it becomes difficult to define the term
      artificial intelligence or AI simply and robustly. Nevertheless I would like to try,
      using examples and historical definitions, to characterize the field of AI. In 1955,
      John McCarthy, one of the pioneers of AI, was the first to define the term artificial
      intelligence, roughly as follows:</p>

    <div class="b">
      <p>The goal of AI is to develop machines that behave as though they were intelligent.</p>
    </div>

    <p>To test this definition, the reader might imagine the following scenario. Fifteen
      or so small robotic vehicles are moving on an enclosed four by four meter
      square surface. One can observe various behavior patterns. Some vehicles form
      small groups with relatively little movement. Others move peacefully through the
      space and gracefully avoid any collision. Still others appear to follow a leader. Aggressive
      behaviors are also observable. Is what we are seeing intelligent behavior?</p>

    <p>According to McCarthy’s definition the aforementioned robots can be described
      as intelligent. The psychologist Valentin Braitenberg has shown that this seemingly
      complex behavior can be produced by very simple electrical circuits. Socalled
      Braitenberg vehicles have two wheels, each of which is driven by an independent
      electric motor. The speed of each motor is influenced by a light sensor on the 
      front of the vehicle as shown in Fig. 1.1. The more light that hits the sensor,
      the faster the motor runs. Vehicle 1 in the left part of the figure, according to its
      configuration, moves away from a point light source. Vehicle 2 on the other hand
      moves toward the light source. Further small modifications can create other behavior
      patterns, such that with these very simple vehicles we can realize the impressive
      behavior described above.</p>
    <p></p>

    <div class="a">
      <p>Two very simple Braitenberg vehicles and their reactions to a light source</p>
    </div>
    <p></p>

    <p>the front of the vehicle as shown in Fig. 1.1. The more light that hits the sensor,
      the faster the motor runs. Vehicle 1 in the left part of the figure, according to its
      configuration, moves away from a point light source. Vehicle 2 on the other hand
      moves toward the light source. Further small modifications can create other behavior
      patterns, such that with these very simple vehicles we can realize the impressive
      behavior described above.</p>

    <p>Clearly the above definition is insufficient because AI has the goal of solving
      difficult practical problems which are surely too demanding for the Braitenberg vehicle.
      In the Encyclopedia Britannica one finds a Definition that goes like:</p>
      
    <div class="b">
      <p>AI is the ability of digital computers or computer controlled robots to solve problems that
        are normally associated with the higher intellectual processing capabilities of humans . . .</p>
    </div>

    <p>But this definition also has weaknesses. It would admit for example that a computer
      with large memory that can save a long text and retrieve it on demand displays
      intelligent capabilities, for memorization of long texts can certainly be considered
      a higher intellectual processing capability of humans, as can for example the quick
      multiplication of two 20-digit numbers. According to this definition, then, every
      computer is an AI system. This dilemma is solved elegantly by the following definition
      by Elaine Rich:</p>

    <div class="b">
      <p>Artificial Intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things at which, at the
        moment, people are better.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Rich, tersely and concisely, characterizes what AI researchers have been doing for
      the last 50 years. Even in the year 2050, this definition will be up to date.</p>

    <p>Tasks such as the execution of many computations in a short amount of time
      are the strong points of digital computers. In this regard they outperform humans by
      many multiples. In many other areas, however, humans are far superior to machines.
      For instance, a person entering an unfamiliar room will recognize the surroundings
      within fractions of a second and, if necessary, just as swiftly make decisions and plan
      actions. To date, this task is too demanding for autonomous robots. According to
      Rich’s definition, this is therefore a task for AI. In fact, research on autonomous
      robots is an important, current theme in AI. Construction of chess computers, on
      the other hand, has lost relevance because they already play at or above the level of
      grandmasters.</p>

    <p>It would be dangerous, however, to conclude from Rich’s definition that AI is
      only concerned with the pragmatic implementation of intelligent processes. Intelligent
      systems, in the sense of Rich’s definition, cannot be built without a deep un-derstanding 
      of human reasoning and intelligent action in general, because of which
      neuroscience is of great importance to AI. This also shows that the
      other cited definitions reflect important aspects of AI.</p>

    <p>A particular strength of human intelligence is adaptivity. We are capable of adjusting
      to various environmental conditions and change our behavior accordingly
      through learning. Precisely because our learning ability is so vastly superior to that
      of computers, machine learning is, according to Rich’s definition, a central subfield
      of AI.</p>
