    <h2>AI History</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>The intellectual roots of AI, and the concept of intelligent machines, may be found in
      Greek mythology. Intelligent artifacts appear in literature since then, with real (and
      fraudulent) mechanical devices actually demonstrated to behave with some degree of
      intelligence. Some of these conceptual achievements are listed below under "Ancient
      History."
      </p>
    <p>After modern computers became available, following World War II, it has become
        possible to create programs that perform difficult intellectual tasks. From these
        programs, general tools are constructed which have applications in a wide variety of
        everday problems. Some of these computational milestones are listed below under
        "Modern History."
