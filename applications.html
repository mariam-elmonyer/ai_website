    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving and growing research area. During the
      last few decades it has expanded from a field of promise to one of actual delivery, with
      good practical application in almost every scientific domain. More specifically, during
      the last 5 years, AI algorithms have been applied more and more by Google in
      Facebook, by Microsoft (e.g., the CNTK that is an open source deep learning toolkit on
      GitHub) by Amazon, and by Baidu in China. The common core of all these recent
      research efforts is deep learning. Joaquin Candela, head of Facebook’s Applied
      Machine Learning group, stated: “We’re trying to build more than 1.5 billion AI
      agents, one for every person who uses Facebook or any of its products.” Facebook is
      using a machine-learning platform known as the FBLearner Flow. In fact, Facebook is
      already building AI that builds AI! Deep learning, deep neural networks, multi-agent
      systems and autonomous agents, image processing, biologically inspired neural networks
      (spiking ANN) are already a reality. Deep neural networks are changing the
      Internet.</p>

      <p>Artificial intelligence has been used in a wide range of
        fields including medical diagnosis, stock trading, robot
        control, law, remote sensing, scientific discovery and toys.
        However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A
        lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications,
        often without being called AI because once something
        becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled
        AI anymore," Nick Bostrom reports. "Many thousands of AI
        applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of
        every industry." the late 90s and early 21st century, AI
        technology became widely used as elements of larger
        systems, but the field is rarely credited for these successes.
